/**
 * A finder of module references.
 *
 * <p> An important property is that a {@code ModuleFinder} admits to
 * at most one module with a given name. A {@code ModuleFinder} that
 * finds modules in a sequence of directories for example, will locate the first
 * occurrence of a module and ignores other modules of that name that appear in
 * directories later in the sequence. </p>
 *
 * <p> Example usage: </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     Path dir1, dir2, dir3;
 *
 *     ModuleFinder finder = ModuleFinder.of(dir1, dir2, dir3);
 *
 *     Optional<ModuleReference> result = finder.find("jdk.foo");
 *     if (result.isPresent()) { ... }
 *
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p> The {@link #find(String) find} and {@link #findAll() findAll} methods
 * defined here can fail for several reasons. These include include I/O errors,
 * errors detected parsing a module descriptor ({@code module-info.class}), or
 * in the case of {@code ModuleFinder} based on a sequence of directories,
 * that two or more versions of the module are found in the same directory.
 * When an error is detected then these methods throw {@link FindException
 * FindException} with a {@link Throwable#getCause cause} where appropriate.
 * The behavior of a {@code ModuleFinder} after a {@code FindException} is
 * thrown is undefined. It is recommended that the {@code ModuleFinder} be
 * discarded after an exception is thrown. </p>
 *
 * <p> A {@code ModuleFinder} is not required to be thread safe. </p>
