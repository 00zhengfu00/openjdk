/**
 * The configuration that is the result of resolution or service binding.
 *
 * <p> Resolution is the process of computing the transitive closure of a set
 * of root modules over a set of observable modules with respect to a
 * dependence relation. Computing the transitive closure results in a
 * <em>dependence graph</em> that is then transformed to a <em>readability
 * graph</em> by adding edges indicated by the readability relation ({@code
 * requires} or {@code requires public}). </p>
 *
 * <p> Suppose we have the following observable modules: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     module m1 { requires m2; }
 *     module m2 { requires public m3; }
 *     module m3 { }
 *     module m4 { }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If the module {@code m1} is resolved then the resulting configuration
 * contains three modules ({@code m1}, {@code m2}, {@code m3}). The edges in
 * its readability graph are: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m1 --> m2  (meaning m1 reads m2)
 *     m1 --> m3
 *     m2 --> m3
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> Resolution is an additive process. The dependence relation may include
 * dependences on modules that have already been instantiated in the Java
 * virtual machine (in a module {@link Layer Layer}). The result is a
 * <em>relative configuration</em> that is relative to a module layer and
 * where readability graph has read edges to modules in the layer (or
 * parent layers). </p>
 *
 * <p> Suppose we have the following observable modules: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     module m1 { requires m2; requires java.xml; }
 *     module m2 { }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If module {@code m1} is resolved with the {@link Layer#boot() boot}
 * layer as the parent layer then the resulting configuration contains two
 * modules ({@code m1}, {@code m2}). The edges in its readability graph
 * are:
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m1 --> m2
 *     m1 --> java.xml
 * } </pre>
 * where module {@code java.xml} is in the parent layer. For simplicity, this
 * example omits the implicitly declared dependence on the {@code java.base}
 * module. </p>
 *
 * <p> Service binding is the process of augmenting a configuration with
 * modules from the set of observable modules induced by the service-use
 * relation. Any module that was not previously in the graph requires
 * resolution to compute its transitive closure. Service binding is an
 * iterative process as adding a module that satisfies some service-use
 * dependence may introduce new service-use dependences. </p>
 *
 * <p> Suppose we have the following observable modules: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     module m1 { uses p.S; }
 *     module m2 { provides p.S with p2.S2; }
 *     module m3 { requires m4; provides p.S with p3.S3; }
 *     module m4 { }
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If the module {@code m1} is resolved then the resulting configuration
 * contains one module ({@code m1}). If service binding is then performed then
 * it results in a new configuration that contains four modules ({@code m1},
 * {@code m2}, {@code m3}, {@code m4}). The edges in its readability graph
 * are:</p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m3 --> m4
 * } </pre>
 * <p> The edges in its service-use graph are: </p>
 * <pre> {@code
 *     m1 --> m2  (meaning m1 uses a service that is provided by m2)
 *     m1 --> m3
 * } </pre>
 *
 * <p> If this configuration is instantiated as a {@code Layer}, and if code in
 * module {@code m1} uses {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader} to
 * iterate over implementations of {@code p.S.class}, then it will iterate over
 * an instance of {@code p2.S2} and {@code p3.S3}. </p>
 *
 * <p> {@code Configuration} defines the {@link #resolve resolve} and {@link
 * #bind bind} methods to do resolution and service binding respectively. It
 * defines the {@link #reads reads} method to examine the readability graph,
 * and the {@link #provides provides} method to get the set of modules in
 * the configuration that provide one or more implementations of a service
 * type. </p>
 *
 * <p> The following example invokes the {@code resolve} method to resolve a
 * module named <em>myapp</em>. It then invokes {@code bind} on the
 * configuration to obtain a new configuration with additional modules (and
 * edges) induced by service-use relationships. </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     ModuleFinder finder = ModuleFinder.of(dir1, dir2, dir3);
 *
 *     Configuration cf
 *         = Configuration.resolve(ModuleFinder.empty(),
 *                                 Layer.boot(),
 *                                 finder,
 *                                 "myapp")
 *                        .bind();
 * }</pre>

     *          of the same module are found in the same directory. </li>
